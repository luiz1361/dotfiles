# Apply these settings to all SSH hosts you connect to
Host *
    # Use SSH protocol version 2 (the only secure one)
    # Default: 2, so this just ensures we don't accidentally use SSH1
    Protocol 2
    # ControlMaster allows SSH to reuse a single connection for multiple sessions
    # Example: If you SSH into the same server multiple times, it will be faster
    # Default: no (opens a new connection every time)
    ControlMaster auto
    # Keep the master connection alive for 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
    # This means you can open new SSH sessions without reconnecting for 30 minutes
    # Default: no (connection closes immediately)
    ControlPersist 1800
    # Enable compression to reduce network traffic
    # Useful on slow networks, may not help much on fast LAN
    # Default: no
    Compression yes
    # Send TCP keep-alive messages to detect if the network drops
    # Default: yes
    TCPKeepAlive yes
    # Send a "still alive" message every 20 seconds to the server
    # Helps detect and close dead sessions before they hang forever
    # Default: 0 (off)
    ServerAliveInterval 20
    # Close the connection if 10 "still alive" messages fail
    # Default: 3
    ServerAliveCountMax 10
    # Only use the SSH key(s) you explicitly specify
    # Prevents trying all keys in your agent or ~/.ssh
    # Default: no
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    # Choose secure encryption algorithms (ciphers) for the connection
    # Default: depends on system (may include less secure ciphers)
    Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
    # Choose secure methods to verify the message integrity (MACs)
    # Default: depends on system
    MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256
    # Control how SSH handles unknown host keys
    # ask = prompt the first time you connect to a new host (safe)
    # no = automatically trust any host key (unsafe)
    # Default: ask
    StrictHostKeyChecking ask
    # File where SSH stores known host keys
    # Default: ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    # Forward your SSH agent to the remote machine (optional)
    # Allows the remote machine to use your keys without copying them
    # Default: no
    ForwardAgent no
    # Allow X11 (graphical) applications to be displayed remotely (optional)
    # Default: no
    ForwardX11 no
